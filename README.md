## How It Works

1. **Game Objective**: The objective of the demo is to move the cars and clear the parking lot.
2. **Game Controls**: Use swipe gestures to move the cars horizontally or vertically.
3. **Level Progression**: As you progress through the levels, the puzzles become more challenging with more cars to maneuver and obstacles to avoid.
